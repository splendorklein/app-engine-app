What additional properties did you add to your models and why?
For the User model, I add "performance" in order to rank users by this property.
For the Game model, I add "current" and "moves" to show the current game status and game history.


What were some of the trade-offs or struggles you faced when implementing the new game logic?
I have to implement the game logic in api although I should do it in another file.
